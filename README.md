Project Notebook for MsC project


Using a combination of natural language processing techniques (NLP) and machine learning
classifiers a pipeline can be built to classify argumentative units and the relations
between them.
In argument mining, the focus is generally on supporting arguments. However, this
project’s main aim was to study conflicts. Specifically, conflicts in political debates, this
project uses transcripts from the US 2016 presidential debates.
Various standard NLP methods were evaluated to see which ones performed best for this
task. In this project, a machine learning model achieved an F1-score of 89% for classifying
related versus random arguments and an F1-score of 69% in classifying conflicting
arguments. The ”same speaker” feature had the best performance, and a Logistic Regression
classifier performed the best overall.
